When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When collaborating.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Some changes may need to be reviewed.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Clone someone's existing code; add branches as necessary.  Fork code that
  shouldn't interfere with existing code.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Allows for easy updating (fast-forward merges) with conflict resolutions.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Exchanging files via email, e.g.  Harder.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    For local or temporary/pending changes.  Complexity.
